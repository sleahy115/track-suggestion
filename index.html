  <p id="story intro">Its another rainy Monday in the city of Portland. You make your way into work, grab your coffee and reluctantly shuffle to your cubicle for another day of exciting customer service inquiries. As you sit down and turn on your computer you notice an odd prompt. "Would you like to do something different today?" Your computer asks. Well, would you?
  <div class="well">
    <h1 class=>Would you like to do something different?<h1>
      <button id="button-y">Yes!</button><button id="button-n">No!</button>
  </div>
  <p id ="no">You dismiss the odd feeling that the prompt gave you and open your normal work. You continue to work in this dead end job until you retire.<p>
  <p id ="yes">As you click on the yes button you are filled with a feeling of promise and excitement. This turns to trepidation as the room begins to swirl around you. You awake in what looks like an artist's studio. There are large canvases lining the walls and a paint splattered woman standing in the corner.Oddly she does not seem to be surprised to see you. As you approach she asks "Would you like to help me paint?" Taken aback a bit you answer...
    <div class="well" id="paint-button">
        <button id="paint-y">Stay and paint</button><button id="paint-n">No, thanks. I'm not an artist.</button>
    </div>
  <p id ="artist">You find yourself agreeing to help. You have always been artistic and it feels right when you pick up a paintbrush</p>
  <p id ="no-artist"> You leave the studio knowing that you have always been more logical than artistic.</p>
  <p id ="story-fork">As you exit the studio knowing that you made the right decision you see a fork in the road. To the right looks like a large modern city in the distance. To the left, you see a small town in the hills. One is calling to you.</p>
  <div class="well" id="city-button">
    <h1>Which one calls to you?<h1>
      <button id="city-y">the city</button><button id="town-y">the town</button>
  </div>
  <p id ="city">The city seems like just where you want to be. You start walking to the right excited to see what is going on in the bustling metropolis.</p>
  <p id ="town">The town looks so homey that your feet are moving to the left almost before you realize it.</p>
  <p id ="story-construct">As you approach you see a structure being built. You know that as a newcomer you can ingratiate yourself with the locals by offering to help. When you approach the foreman you are told that you can either assist the construction crew or work with the interior designer. You know right away which you would rather do.</p>
    <div class="well" id="build-button">
      <h1>Which do you perfer?<h1>

  <p id ="story-tinker">After a great day on the build site you are directed to a local hotel, on the way you see an odd workshop and the proprietor invites you in. Inside you realize that he is an inventor. He tells you that he loves to make things that move, that are interactive. He asks you if you would like to help with his newest creation, one that is all about the user and how they interact with the work. </p>
    <div class="well" id="interactive-button">
      <h1>Stay and help with the interactive invention<h1>

  <p id="tinker">You agree to stay and help. You have always loved to tinker, and you love to have the ability to interact with things as much as possible.</p>
  <p id="no-tinker">You admire the inventor but decline his offer. You never really cared to tinker with things and prefer that they be more fixed.</p>
  <p id="story-conclusion">As you walk along the road you see the hotel. Are you ready to lay down your weary head, or will you keep exploring and stay mobile?(prompt for bed or mobile)</p>
